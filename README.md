This simple Python project is an application that uses the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface resembling a vending machine. The code is organized using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques, making it easy to manage and extend. Additionally, it incorporates the Twilio API to send SMS notifications about purchases and prices to the machine's owner, offering a convenient way to keep track of sales. For the most accurate and realistic representation, the code was deployed on a small touchscreen connected to a Raspberry Pi.
